### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
All great things begins with a clueless curious person seeking the next opportunity to understand the unknown.

# Let me introduce myself: I..
- am 22-year old Filipino currently residing at Batangas, Philippines.
- am currently taking BS Mechanical Engineering at Batangas State University Alangilan Campus.
- like dogs (I have a 7-year old shihtzu), progressive house music, party games, and reading YA books.
- love exploring new ideas, unlocking new skills, meeting wonderful people, and growing as a person.
- got into code during the 2019 pandemic; and
- believe I have so much to learn from excellent people here.
