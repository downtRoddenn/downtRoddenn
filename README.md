### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
All great discoveries begins with a clueless curious explorer seeking the next opportunity to understand the unknown.

## Let me introduce myself: I..
- am 23-year old Filipino currently residing at Batangas, Philippines.
- am currently taking BS Mechanical Engineering at Batangas State University Alangilan Campus.
- like dogs (I have a 8-year old shihtzu), progressive house music, party games, and reading YA books.
- love exploring new ideas, unlocking new skills, meeting wonderful people, and growing as a person.
- got into code during the 2019 pandemic; and
- believe I have so much to learn from excellent people here.

### How new am I?
- I know HTML and CSS
- I know Javascript (mostly node)
- I know Python (school related projects)
- I came here to read and learn simple projects, ascend in difficulty, and start writing my own projects.
- It would be nice to meet like-minded people along the way. ðŸ˜„
